Projects include practice using HTML, JavaScript, and Java.

All Java projects were made in Eclipse and compiled and run using Java1.8. 

All projects were made as sample websites for the fictional Beartooth Hiking Company.

html_homework1.html and html_homework2.html are the first and second iterations of this site. Other projects have corresponding documentation within the project folder.
